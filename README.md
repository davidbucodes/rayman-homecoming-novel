# Rayman Homecoming Novel (work in progress)

This project is a fan based interactive light-novel engine built upon PIXI.JS using vanilla TypeScript.  
The engine focuses on rendering predefined yaml story chapter files.  
Aside from the main app, a dedicated app for creating story chapters is available.


The story revolves about Rayman returning to The Valley a year after the completion of Rayman 1.

This is a woork in progess project, so some bugs might occur while playing.  
Please run this at a full screen Chrome browser.  
Please install Japanese language voices from Windows settings.
